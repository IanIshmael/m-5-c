## Description

 This project is to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

- What was my motivation? My motivation for this project was to understand third party API's such as Bootstrap and jQuery. 
- What problem does it solve? This can help users keep track of their schedule and plan things easier.
- What did I learn? I learned how to implement Bootstrap and jQuery and understanding the concept of third party API's.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install my project?

- If you decide to install and use please contact me through my email letting me know so that we can colaberate together and make it the best user expeirience that we can.(@Ians_email.com).
- In order to get exact code you will need my git hub repository.
- In oder to add any new features you will some sort of code editor (I prefer Visual Studio Code)
- In order to see what you are working on you will any browser of your choice. (I prefer Google Chrome)

## Features

- The first thing that should be noted is that right under "Work Day Scheduler A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day" you will see that there is text that will give the current day and date. 
- The user will be able to write in between the hour and save button. They can also change or add on to whatever they decide to do. 
- The user will be able to save what ever they wrote and if they refresh the page the text will still be there. 
- If it is past the current time the text area will be color coded to gray. 
- If it is the current time the text area will be color coded to red. 
- If it is before the current time the text area will be color coded to green.
